- Source branch and base commit: `main`, `c0ea50820094952b3bad9c83b45cc00cbff0381c`.
- Application package version: 0.9.1.
- Source remediation branch: `fix/t003-backend-authorization-2026-10-29`.
- Current documentation branch: `docs/application-review-2026-10-30`.
- Verification branch retained: `docs/t003-auth-lock-verification-2026-10-29` from `229a098f375050be1c5d4cd45236b5e0ec903325`.
- Branch HEAD: resolve with Git (`git rev-parse HEAD`); do not copy a commit's own SHA into this document.
- Local validation environment: Node.js 24.12.0 and npm 11.6.2.
- Current scope: documentation only. Reconcile the latest source and reported evidence, produce full module/requirement coverage and detailed specifications, and collect owner decisions. No application or tooling source, dependency, migration or security logic changes.

## What is established

- Active runtime remains Electron main/preload with renderer IPC to local SQLite under Electron `userData`.
- T-001 remains partial: automatic repository-instruction loading is still unverified.
- T-002 installation/toolchain fixes remain intact.
- T-003 now has implemented backend enforcement for the previously confirmed unauthenticated and cross-engagement IPC defects.

## Earlier T-003 reported remediation evidence

The following application execution results were reported by the prior VS Code session and retained at the reviewed baseline. They were not rerun as part of this documentation pass. Full UI behaviour and unresolved policies remain separate.


The harness runs the real production handlers (`electron/main.cjs`, `electron/preload.cjs`) in an isolated temporary profile via `scripts/t003-electron-entry.cjs` and `scripts/test-t003-authorization.cjs`. It verifies that the temporary database does not exist before loading main, then exercises the actual preload API with synthetic users/data.

Implemented backend changes:

- Added centralized authorization checks in `electron/sqlite-authorization.cjs`.
- `sqlite-query` now rejects unauthenticated access, validates table/action, enforces filtered-only update/delete, and applies engagement-scoped checks for select/update/delete/insert/upsert.
- Cross-engagement forged-ID mutations are denied.
- Protected role and sensitive field updates are denied.
- Cross-engagement `evidence_links` insertion/read paths are blocked.
- Evidence file path/save/download/delete handlers now require authentication and evidence metadata ownership checks.
- Admin behavior follows approved task choice: partner-equivalent permissions plus global engagement scope.

Latest isolated regression result:

- `node --test scripts/test-t003-authorization.cjs`: **passed** (26 tests, 26 passed, 0 failed), including four review-finding regressions that failed before the fixes (canonical file ownership, parent-key moves, trial balance authorization, scoped upload rollback).

Observation-only cases intentionally remain:

- Evidence `locked`/`approval_stage` transition policy is still unresolved and not yet enforced by finalized business rules.
- Export while logged out still succeeds to local downloads; export authorization policy remains unresolved.

## Validation summary

**Passed**

- `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund`
- `node --check electron/sqlite-authorization.cjs`
- `node --check electron/main.cjs`
- `node --check scripts/test-t003-authorization.cjs`
- `node --test scripts/test-t003-authorization.cjs` (26/26 pass)
- `npm run test:native`, `npx vitest run src/lib` (8 files, 37 tests), `npm run test:classification`, `npm run test:bulk-update`, `npm run build`

**Failed (existing baseline, tracked separately)**

- `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit`: existing diagnostics baseline (T-013).
- `npm run lint`: existing lint baseline (T-014).

**Not established in this scope**

- Installer/release validation.
- Cross-platform runtime validation.
- ODBC/Tally integration validation.
- Owner UAT.

## Blocking or material gaps

1. Export authorization policy remains undefined at the backend boundary.
2. Evidence approval/review/lock/reopen transition rules require product decisions before final enforcement.
3. Long-term role mapping decisions for `viewer` and `user` remain open.
4. TypeScript and lint baselines remain failing and must be triaged separately.
5. Prototype feature gaps remain for Misstatements and Completion (T-007 scope continues separately).

## Documentation review result

Prepared the owner review edition and 19 canonical module specifications covering all 28 feature IDs; traced 35 original Phase I statements/blueprint proposals; documented principal business fields, rules, outputs, permission boundaries and acceptance scenarios. Added a 78-table/1,055-column declared-schema catalogue, persistence caller catalogue and tax clause/field catalogue with extraction limits. Consolidated 16 owner review groups and known implementation/verification gaps.

Documentation-only checks completed on Node.js 24.22.1: `node scripts/check-project-docs.mjs` passed, and `node --test scripts/check-project-docs.test.mjs` passed one regression test with zero failures. Additional review validation passed for 61 Markdown files, 617 local links, all 28 feature IDs, 19 module sections, 35 traced source statements, 60 unique proposed acceptance cases and 16 owner review groups. Source anchors exist and all 46 changed paths are Markdown or documentation JSON. `git diff --check` passed; staged/final diff is checked at commit. No application tests or legal review were rerun.

## First next activity

The owner reviews REVIEW_START_HERE.md and APPLICATION_REVIEW.md and records decisions/corrections in OWNER_REVIEW_DECISIONS.md. Update the canonical modules and approved scope after that review. Do not automatically start export-policy implementation, schema repair, security remediation, typecheck or lint work from the previous handoff. Those remain documented pending tasks requiring a separate implementation request.
